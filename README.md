 Design Patterns Sample Project

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use structural and creational design patterns in a software solution.

## Introduction

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. This project includes implementations of several structural and creational design patterns.

## Patterns Implemented

### Structural Patterns
1. **Adapter Pattern**: 
    - The adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. This is typically achieved by creating a wrapper class that translates requests from one interface to another.

2. **Decorator Pattern**: 
    - The decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.

3. **Proxy Pattern**: 
    - The proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This can be useful for implementing lazy initialization, access control, logging, etc.

### Creational Patterns
1. **Factory Pattern**: 
    - The factory pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. It involves a factory class with a method that returns instances of different classes based on input parameters or other criteria.
